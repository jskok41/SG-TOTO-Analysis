# Deployment Guide - Fixing Build Failures

## Problem
The build is failing due to SciPy compilation issues during pip installation. This is common when deploying Python applications with C extensions to serverless platforms like Vercel.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Minimal Requirements (Recommended)
Use the minimal requirements file that excludes SciPy:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

This uses the modified version of your code that implements the normal distribution function manually without requiring SciPy.

### Option 2: Use Pre-compiled Wheels
The current `requirements.txt` uses specific versions that should have pre-compiled wheels available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: Platform-Specific Solutions

#### For Vercel:
1. Use the `vercel.json` configuration file provided
2. Set the Python version in `runtime.txt`
3. Consider using the minimal requirements approach

#### For Other Platforms:
1. Ensure you have build tools installed
2. Use a platform that supports C compilation
3. Consider using Docker with pre-built images

## Files Created

1. **`requirements.txt`** - Full requirements with specific versions
2. **`requirements-minimal.txt`** - Minimal requirements without SciPy
3. **`runtime.txt`** - Python version specification
4. **`vercel.json`** - Vercel deployment configuration
5. **`toto_analysis_no_scipy.py`** - Modified analysis without SciPy dependency
6. **`main_no_scipy.py`** - Main file using the no-SciPy version

## Testing the Fix

1. Try installing with minimal requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
   ```

2. Test the no-SciPy version:
   ```bash
   python main_no_scipy.py
   ```

3. If you need the full functionality with SciPy, try the full requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Use a different platform** that supports C compilation (Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)
2. **Use Docker** with a pre-built Python image that includes build tools
3. **Use cloud-based development environments** like Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks

## Notes

- The manual implementation of `norm_ppf()` is an approximation but should be sufficient for most statistical analysis
- For production use with heavy statistical computations, consider using a platform that supports SciPy compilation
- The confidence interval calculations will work with the manual implementation, though with slightly less precision than SciPy's implementation
